Students worked on a project about climate data. The project required students to clean data, explore data, and present results. During analysis, the team ran an analysis of errors and an analysis of trends. The model was simple, but the model produced useful feedback for the students. After the first prototype, the team refined the prototype and shared results in class. In the final review, the project summary highlighted analysis choices, model limits, and next steps.


=== SUMMARY ===
Total words: 76
Unique words: 47

Top repeated words (excluding common stopwords):
  analysis          4  ( 5.3%)
  data              3  ( 3.9%)
  model             3  ( 3.9%)
  project           3  ( 3.9%)
  students          3  ( 3.9%)
  prototype         2  ( 2.6%)
  results           2  ( 2.6%)
  team              2  ( 2.6%)

Repeated phrases (bigrams):
  an analysis                    2
  analysis of                    2
  the model                      2
  the project                    2
  the team                       2

Repeated phrases (trigrams):
  an analysis of                 2

Hint: The word 'analysis' appears 4 times (5.3%). Consider varying wording or using synonyms to reduce repetition.
